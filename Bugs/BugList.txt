List of known bugs

1) When a robot reaches the top of the map it will throw an undefined error.
   - Might be due to trying to move the unit out of bounds?

2) After a certain point/destination has been assigned the unit will path towards the enemy castle
   even though its destination is put somewhere else.

3) Pilgrims are freezing up.
   - this might be due to the path finding algorithm not finishing or taking to long because there is
      no  possible path due to units blokcking? maybe not to sure
